With the purpose of settle the knowledge acquired during the Data Structures course, was implemented by means of the structures learned in  class, a representation of a relational database that saves the employeeâ€™s registers of a company in order to keep track of finances. 

The implemented structures were HashTables and AVL Trees which file the inserted data by user, generating three distinct tables: Names, Invoices and Expenses. All data is saved through distinct types of node objects. There are several public and private methods to perform the required functionalities from the database.

### The core functions of the system are:

- Search a particular node.  
- Insertion of a particular node.   
- Deletion of a particular node.  
- Update attributes of a node.  
- Fast access to the nodes information.   
- Compare the nodes information.   
- Print the tables.
